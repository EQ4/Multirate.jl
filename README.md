**Multirate** is a package for the creation and execution of state-preserving FIR filters which perform sample rate changes. The input to output sample-rate ratio can be 1 (no change), 1/M (decimation), L/1 (interpolation), or L/M (rational), where L & M are integers.


# Installation

Multirate is not registered, you must clone it it:

```julia
Pkg.add( "Multirate" )
```

**Multirate** depends on **[DSP](https://github.com/JuliaDSP/DSP.jl)** for [windowing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function) functions.

# Usage

## Stateless ##

Use these methods if only want to resample a vector in one chunk.

In these examples, `x` and `h` are previously defined signal & filter-taps vectors.

```julia
using Multirate

# decimate by 3
y = filt( h, x, 1//3 )

# interpolate by 3 
y = filt( h, x, 3//3 )

# resample with a ratio of 3/4
# equivalent to interpolating by 3, then decimating by 4
# ( but much more efficient )
y = filt( h, x, 3//4 )
```

## State-preserving ##

To use **Multirate**'s stateful filtering functionality, you must first create a filter object. Every time to call `filt` with that object, the filtering picks up where you left off. This is good for processing large vectors from a file, or filtering an stream of samples with indefinite length.

Each filter object is of type `FIRFilter{Tk<:FIRKernel}`. `Tk` can either be `FIRStandard`, `FIRInterpolator`, `FIRDecimator`, or `FIRRational`. The type of `FIRKernel` created is determined by the value of the ratio you pass to the `FIRFilter` constructor. If you do not pass a ratio, a single-rate `FIRStardard` kernel is created.

In the following example, we will be resampling with a ratio of 3/17. Please note that h in this example is contrived to show you the input to output progressions. It performs no useful signal filtering.

```jlcon
julia> x = [ 1.0:100 ]

Let's check that `y`, created by filtering three separate chunks of `x`, matches the result we would obtain from stateless filtering.

```jlcon
julia> sum( y .- filt( h, x, 3//17 ) )
0.0
```
